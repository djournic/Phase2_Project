This is the repository for my Phase 2 Porject

Here you will find the csv file used for the 3 jupyter notebooks of code. The goal was to create a linear regression model to solve a specific problem, that we were to assign ourselves. I chose to create a predictor for home price based on 4 criteria in the csv: living area, lot size, bedrooms and bathrooms.
I chose those variables because I thought they were universal in the home buying process. True, there are others that can be used, but these were elements everyone considered.
The first notebook is the rough book; where I felt my way through the task. I tried trimming the data, log transforming, scaling etc without any real plan. Trying out different things just to see what would work.
The second notebook is the clean one: this one had a much more focused approach. The third is the revised notebook, that I made in response to the feedback from my evaluation, mostly just to add the missing elements from the clean book.
Interestingly the initial regression model worked the best, and even that wasn't very good. I tried log transforming the data, trimming it and otherwise manipulating it to try to improve the score but nothing seemed to work. 
The csv we were given is housing data from King County, WA.
After multiple linear regressions, and several attempts to manipulate the data into something that'll conform to a nice model, I ended up using the original, unedited data.
