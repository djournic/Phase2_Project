# Phase2_Project
This is the repository for my Phase 2 Porject

Here you will find the csv file used for the 2 jupyter notebooks of code. The goal was to create a linear regression model to solve a specific problem, that we were to assign ourselves. I chose to create a predictor or home price based on 4 criteria in the csv: living area, lot size, bedrooms and bathrooms.
Interestingly the initial regression model worked the best, and even that wasn't very good. I tried log transforming the data, trimming it and otherwise manipulating it to try to improve the score but nothing seemed to work.
